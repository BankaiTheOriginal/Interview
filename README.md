# ðŸŽ¨ Shirt Color Frequency Analysis

This Python project analyzes the shirt colors worn by Bincom staff over a week. It extracts data from a provided webpage, computes statistical insights, and stores the results in a PostgreSQL database. Additional utilities include binary conversion, Fibonacci sum calculation, and a recursive search function.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

1. **Mean Color** â€“ Determines the shirt color at the average index after sorting by frequency.
2. **Most Frequent Color** â€“ Identifies the most worn color of the week.
3. **Median Color** â€“ Calculates the median shirt color based on frequency distribution.
4. **Color Variance** â€“ Computes the variance of color frequencies to assess spread.
5. **Probability of Red** â€“ Calculates the probability of randomly selecting "Red".
6. **Database Storage** â€“ Saves the frequency data into a PostgreSQL database.
7. **Recursive Search** â€“ Performs recursive search on a number list.
8. **Binary to Decimal Converter** â€“ Converts a 4-digit binary string to decimal.
9. **Fibonacci Sum** â€“ Calculates the sum of the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
